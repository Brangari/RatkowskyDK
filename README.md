Abstract: Temperature impacts on microbiological processes are crucial for soil biogeochemistry and ecosystem functioning, yet existing models either fail to capture microbial temperature dependences across the full biokinetic range or risk overparameterization. Here, we present the "Dual-Kinetics Ratkowsky" model (Ratkowsky DK), capable of simultaneously describing temperature dependences of microbial growth (anabolism) and respiration (catabolism). A comparison with established models (Arrhenius, Ratkowsky, MMRT, and MMRT-2S) using data from 70 soils along a climate gradient demonstrated the superior performance and parsimony of Ratkowsky DK, with strong implications for estimating soil carbon stock changes across local to continental scales and under both current and future climate conditions. Although empirically derived, the model provides reliable estimates of microbial thermal traits and their climate responsiveness, reflecting warm- and cold-shifted adaptations. It also offers a biological interpretation whereby temperature-driven cell death fuels respiration beyond a threshold, explaining the decoupling between anabolism and catabolism. Thus, Ratkowsky DK represents a promising tool for advancing our understanding of microbial and biogeochemical responses to climate and implementation of ecology into Earth system representations.
